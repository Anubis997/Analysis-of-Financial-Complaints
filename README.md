#  Analysis of Financial Complaints-KPI Dashboard

• The objective is to prioritize complaints first by analyzing them based on media, product, issue, and geography.
• Percentage metrics were calculated for KPIs such as timely response, tickets in progress, and tickets resolved at no cost.
  Complaints were grouped by issue, state, media, and product. The metrics can be viewed across different dates using the date
  knob to help the manager visualize trends more effectively.
• By enabling safer transaction with credit cards, which account for more than 25% of the complaints, the percentage of tickets
  resolved at no cost can be increased from 84.5% to 87%, leading to a decrease in Operating expenditure and boosting profit.
